# Notification Service

Consumes RabbitMQ events and sends transactional emails via Resend. Persists every notification attempt to PostgreSQL for auditability.

## Stack

- **NestJS** — framework (hybrid HTTP + RabbitMQ microservice)
- **TypeORM** — ORM for PostgreSQL with entity-based schema sync
- **PostgreSQL** — notification log (status, payload, errors)
- **RabbitMQ** — event consumer (manual ack, durable queue)
- **Resend** — email delivery

## Event Types

| Event | Recipient | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `application.submitted` | Candidate + Employer | Candidate applies |
| `application.screened` | Candidate | Status → Screened |
| `application.interview` | Candidate | Status → Interview |
| `application.hired` | Candidate | Status → Hired |
| `application.rejected` | Candidate | Status → Rejected |
| `job.published` | Employer | Saga step 4 complete |
| `job.payment_failed` | Employer | Saga payment failure |
| `job.new_applicant` | Employer | Standalone applicant notify |

## Quick Start

```bash
# fill in RESEND_API_KEY + RESEND_FROM in .env
docker-compose up
```

## Database Configuration

Set PostgreSQL environment variables in `.env`:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=notification_admin
DB_PASSWORD=notification_password
DB_NAME=notifications_db
```

On startup, the service initializes TypeORM and synchronizes the `notifications` table from entity metadata when `NODE_ENV` is not `production`.

## Publishing an Event from other services

Publish a JSON object to the `notifications` queue. The `eventType` field determines which template fires.

**Application event:**
```json
{
  "eventType": "application.submitted",
  "applicationId": "uuid",
  "jobId": "uuid",
  "jobTitle": "Senior Engineer",
  "candidateEmail": "candidate@example.com",
  "candidateName": "Jane Doe",
  "employerEmail": "hr@company.com",
  "employerCompany": "Acme Corp"
}
```

**Job event:**
```json
{
  "eventType": "job.published",
  "jobId": "uuid",
  "jobTitle": "Senior Engineer",
  "employerEmail": "hr@company.com",
  "employerName": "John Smith"
}
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Manual ACK** — message is only acknowledged after the DB write succeeds. A failed email is recorded as `FAILED` but still ACKed — bad emails shouldn't block the queue.
- **NACK without requeue** on unhandled exceptions — sends to the dead-letter exchange rather than causing an infinite retry loop.
- **Payload stored as JSONB** — every original event is persisted for debugging and potential replays.
- **No calls to other services** — all required data must be in the event payload (enforced by validation DTOs). This keeps the service decoupled and respects the K8s network policy.
